## rpyramid.s

Implement a MIPS assembly program that prints out the reverse pyramid of numbers as shown below.

## caesar.s

Implement the Caesar Cipher program using MIPS assembly.
※ Reference #1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher   
(Caesar Cipher typically uses ‘left shift of 3’. That is, D is replaced by A and E is replaced by B.)   
※ Reference #2: please refer to the attached file ‘ascii.s’ for printing ascii code.   

## inorder.s

Implement a MIPS assembly program that performs inorder traversal in binary search tree using recursion. Suppose the binary search tree is represented by array as shown in C code below. In MIPS code, you must declare an array for tree using ‘.data’ and its label must be ‘tree’ as shown below. Also you must implement this program using $ra, saved registers, and stack in your code.   
※ Reference: please refer to the attached file ‘inorder.c’ for C code example. 

## sqrt.s

Write a MIPS assembly program that determines square root. You can use the Babylonian method for computing square root shown below. In this problem, use single-precision floating point number.
※ Hint: Please refer to f2c.s
